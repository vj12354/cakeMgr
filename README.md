# Cake Manager Micro Service API 

Run it via maven command: 
> mvn spring-boot:run

Now the Cake RESTful services are available at:
http://localhost:8080/api/cakes

So you can try:
> curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/cakes

Should also support:
POST DELETE PUT methods
